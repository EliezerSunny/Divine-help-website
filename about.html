                    <h3 class="head-tittle">THE HISTORY OF ESTABLISHMENT OF ONA IWA MIMO C&S CHURCH, DIVINE HELP.</h3>

                    <p>
                        There are many messages of God that were received by the servant of God, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EliezerSunny/Divine-help-website/refs/heads/main/img/Apostle Ezra Adebayo Adetunji.jpg" alt="Apostle Ezra Adebayo Adetunji" style=" border-radius:10px; width:20%; float:right;" >Apostle Ezra Adebayo Adetunji, about the plan of God to establish church through him. Some of these messages were sent through prophets and prophetess, while some messages were sent directly to him.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        God revealed His mission to establish His church through Apostle Ezra Adetunji to prophetess Esther Olayemi Ojuoluwa. From Erekiti Ondo State, on 5th July, 2017. Prophetess Esther Ojuoluwa received another message from God on wednesday, 3rd october, 2018 that Apostle Adetunji should establish church.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Wednesday 3rd october, 2018 God sent the following messages to Apostle Ezra Adetunji through prophet James Koredele Olalowo. From Oyo, Oyo State. The message goes thus: <b>1.</b> <i>"It is time for you to go out and establish the church of the Lord"</i>. In the message the location of the church was mentioned (along Oloko-road, Igboho, Oyo State. Nigeria).  <b>2.</b> <i>"Apostle Ezra Adetunji was mandated by God to begin process for ordination as prophet"</i>. To this effect Bayo Adetunji harken to the Word of God and was ordained as prophet on 28th October, 2018 by spiritual father (General Overseer) of Ona Iwa Mimo Cherubim and Seraphim church, Nigeria and Overseas. In person of Joseph Aderibigbe Ibikunle(COM, JP).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Prophet Olalowo added <i>"you are raise for the rise of some people and the fall of some people, don't be afraid".</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On 7th October, 2018 Apostle Ezra Adetunji himself received message from God which confirmed many messages through prophets and prophetess that he should rise up and establish the church.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a dream he (Adetunji) had. He received message of God through one of the late spiritual father (General Overseer) of Ona Iwa Mimo Cherubim and Seraphim late Jacob Oyesiji(COM). The message goes thus <i>"my Son we see your commitment and your conserted efforts to the service of God and humanity towards the stability and expansion of the church of God and spreading the gospel. You are highly commended. Go ahead with good services to God, for God is with you always"</i>. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is another Word of God that came to his servant through prophetess Caroline Oladele of Akure, Ondo State. <i>"It is true that God send you to establish His church, don't tary and do not fear, for God is by your Sides"</i>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moreover, in a dream had by Mrs. Racheal Adetunji (the minister's wife) on 18th December, 2018 that God has prepared a room upstair for She and her husband, where many people will run to for their safety.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The establishment of the church. On 6th October, 2018, the proposed land for the new church was reached by prophet Ezra Adebayo and prophet James Olalowo to sanctify the land in preparation for the commencement of first Sunday service. The formal launching of the church came up on 23rd December, 2018 when first Sunday service was observed. In attendance were prophet Ezra Adebayo and his family.

    				<h3 class="head-tittle">THE HISTORY OF ESTABLISHMENT OF ONA IWA MIMO C&S CHURCH, NIGERIA AND OVERSEAS.</h3>
    <p> 
    The Spiritual father, Prophet Jacob Oke Adeola who was sent by God to established the Church-Ona Iwa Mimo C$S in Nigeria and overseas was born into the family of Chief Erinjakun, Obaago Igboho. He was from a traditional religion by birth. Oke Adeola fell into the Christ fold when Christianity came to Igboho through the White missionaries in the year 1922. The Holy Spirit began to showed up more in his life while in the Baptist Church as his mode of dressing, praying, and Bible teaching, though he did not go to any formal School. The above mentioned subjects were a new phenomenon to his contemporary in the Church, and himself. 
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EliezerSunny/Divine-help-website/refs/heads/main/img/congregation.jpg" alt="Congregation" style=" border-radius:50%; width:25%; float:right;" >The people termed the above activities as anti baptismal doctrines. He was alleged as practicing anti-Baptismal doctrine. This allegations levelled against him made Rev'd Powell set up a committee at the tail end of the year 1937. To look into the matter and if it was true, he should be corrected. As a successful business man, he and his wife Sarah Olatowon Adeola set up for his business journey on the 19th day of February 1938 to the the Northern part of Nigeria a place called Gidansabo in Niger State of Nigeria.</p>

<p>It was on his returned journey to the Southern part of the country on the 12th of December, 1938 with his cattle-cow, goat, and sheep that he was fully encountered by the Holy Spirit at a place called Dinkara Gbesai, but now being called Gidansana. It was from there, that he was then taking miraculously to a pictorially shown mountain called by the people of the area as AWI MOUNTAIN below. The name was coined out of the Spiritual father's constant pronouncement of Mawi Oluwa nitori ti Iranse Re n gbo- Lord continue saying as your servant hear. The Prophet used 83 days (day and night) without food. It was on this mountain that the Lord told him name of the Church He would make him to establish ONA IWA MIMO C$S CHURCH. The Church services began fully at Olanikomo Isale compound, Obaago, Igboho in September 1939, after he was sent out of the Baptist Church in June 1939. Note: The Bible says <i>"We would know the truth, and the truth will make us free"</i>. The phenomenon at the time as said above was a new thing to the then Christians. But it could be liken to what happened to Jesus Christ and the Jewish people. Hence, Baba's exist from the Baptist Church was the will of the Most High God. We should not take much offence on them that does the work. Thus, this was how Ona Iwa Mimo Cherubim and Seraphim Church took off. The Church's Annual Hilltop Ascension took off in the year 1946 October, at Kero forest, a quarter of town. The procession to the said area for special prayer was three times before it was spiritually changed to another place, of course, the present one in the year 1952 October.</p>
